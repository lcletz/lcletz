## Hi everyone!
I'm Laura C, I'm a student in Statistics and Data Sciences.

Until this day, I've worked on the interactive features of the website [PÃ©daler Ã  Montpellier](https://elqemmahdoha.github.io/TEAM_PROJECT/) and I'm now studying conformal prediction to improve scoring in PlantNet mobile app, and creating a Takuzu game using R-Shiny also as part of my studies.
