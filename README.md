## Hi everyone!
I'm Laura CLETZ, a French student in BioStatistics and Data Sciences. 
I'm passionate about both applied and pure Mathematics, and hope that my studies will enable me to become a data analyst in the fields of Biology and Ecology, or even better, in Meteorological or Psychiatric research! Well... anything I guess!
Please, do not hesitate to contact me. 🥰

Allow me to show you some of my work in chronological order!

🚲 **Pédaler à Montpellier** 🚲
I worked on the interactive features of the website [Pédaler à Montpellier](https://elqemmahdoha.github.io/TEAM_PROJECT/). As part of this project, we had to create a website using the open database of the city of Montpellier, France, which would detail and forecast the cyclists and pedestrians traffic in the city for each day of the week. I created the interactive, color-blind map on the main page and the bar chat in the statistics section.

🎲 **Takuzu/Binairo** 🎲
As part of my studies, I had to fully master the R language. In this regard, as part of an assignment to be completed in pairs, we coded a Takuzu game using R-Shiny that you can find [here](https://github.com/KatyaStetsun/TakuzuKL). I coded the base of the game logic and the C++ (Rcpp) part that calculates all the possible grids, and designed the title and the images for the different levels.

🌿 **Conformal prediction and PlantNet** 🌿
The work that I'm most proud of is certainly this [project](https://github.com/lcletz/PLANTNET_M1_SSD)! We studied a huge database of the PlantNet mobile application to apply conformal prediction and thus improve the app by displaying only the smallest set of labels (species) with 95% confidence that the correct species is shown. I worked mainly on descriptive statistics, but also on calculating the majority vote and processing the 7 mn datas so that my colleagues could calculate the scores and try out different calibration methods. Important information: I had two wonderful and serious coworkers and two really supportive supervisors!

🚱 **Water contamination from former mine** 🚱
My latest work is an 2-months internship where the codes are available [here](https://github.com/lcletz/PollutionEauxCarnoules). I had to explore a physico-chemicals' database in order to determine correlations and interactions between rainfall and chemicals found in the water near a former mine in Gard, France. The results will allow HydroSciences Montpellier to get an idea of how many samples a year they will need to monitor efficiently the site.
